## Recursion
Divide a problem into similar subproblems

### Mathematical Induction
For every integer n >= a, a property P(n) is true.
1. Basis Step
   - Show that P(a) is true.
2. Inductive Step
   - Show that for every integer k >= a, if P(k) is true then P(k+1) is true
   - Suppose that P(k) is true
     - This Supposition (Assumption) is called the inductive hypothesis
   - Then, show that P(k+1) is true

Hint Remember: Sequence & Mathematica Induction
