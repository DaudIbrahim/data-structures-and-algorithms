# PROBLEM SETS

## Problem Solving `Goal`
[The Focus Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvrleanEYOw&t=37s "Grant Sanderson") that you are spending should be on solving specific problems. Try to push yourself to solve more problems than you naturally would.

## Learning Problems `Approach`
It is more important to be able to [recognize a problem](https://qr.ae/priZWZ "John Byrd"), than to remember an algorithm that solves it.

- Learn/Recogize Problems
- Identify Patterns
- Create Solutions

## Nature of the Scientific Process
Problem sets are great ways to provide students with the practice necessary to gain mastery of new skills that you have introduced in class. Problem sets are also great at reflecting the nature of the [scientific process](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/problem-sets "Harvard University"), which so often involves problem solving, and in so doing help reinforce the explanatory power of your discipline.
